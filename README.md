# Bugger
Simple big management.

# To the run the project:
  * cd into the project.
  * bundle install.
  * bundle exec rails db:migrate.
  * bundle exec rails db:seed.
  * bundle exec rails server.

# Database configuration:
  * Currently you can change the database config to match the database provider you need.
  
# Seed:
  It will give you 3 accounts:
  * Manager: m@bugger.com
  * Developer: d@bugger.com
  * QA: q@bugger.com
  
# What can be improved:
  * There is no UI for the project and needs to be added.
  * The flow can be alot simpler and more mainstream.
  * There is no notification system for the users.
  * Unit and integration tests are missing.
  * There is no proper managment of users and roles.
  * There is no proper role provider.
